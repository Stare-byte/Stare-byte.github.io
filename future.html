        <h3>My Future Plans</h3>
        <p>&emsp; Regarding my future plans, my current ones consist of attending Sinclair
            Community College and acquiring an Associates Degree in Computer Science,
            funded through merit scholarships as well as the Governer's Merit Scholarship, the Requirements
            plastered together on the table below.
        </p>    
        <p> &emsp; After obtaining my Associates Degree in Computer Science, 
            I plan to attend Wright State and attend for 3 years using their 4+1 program for Computer Engineering, 
            already having completed about 2 years using my Associate's Degree from Sinclair.  This will give me the 
            necessary expertise to flourish within my field, as well as attend and complete a variety of different
            jobs.
