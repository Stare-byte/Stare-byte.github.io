           &emsp; Hello there! Welcome to my website, this is a website to feature information about me and
            hopefully get a look into my work ethic, hobbies, interests, and more!
            Whether you are a fellow student, a potential employer, or a teacher,
            I welcome you to look into these to get an idea of my interests!
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp; I've been attending Kettering Fairmont ever since about halfway through my 4th grade year, 
            which has allowed me to flourish as a student with the oppurtunity this wonderful community that I have been gifted.  
            Ever since I attended Fairmont, I've been placed on the honor roll for as long as I can remember, 
            or attending Honors/AP/IB/CTC classes.  
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp;  I plan on attaining the Computer Science Associates Degree at Sinclair Community College, 
            before using the Wright Path program to transfer for Wright State's 4+1 Masters Program into Computer Engineering to 
            complete my Masters Degree of Computer Engineering, of which my plans for tuition costs and attendance can further be found <a href="future.html">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp; This website is a product of the CTC program hosted via Sinclair Community College with Kettering Fairmont Highschool, and represents an accumulation of some of the 
            html and css knowledge I have been taught and understood.
