        <h3>Marching Band</h3>
        <p>&emsp;I participated in the Marching Firebirds for 2 years during my Freshman and Sophomore years of high school.
            During that time, Fairmont came .25 points away from qualifying for the finals BOA Super Regional
            Competition hosted at Indianapolis,
            as well as close to first at the OMEA State finals.
            On top of that, recently Fairmont has had a national-award-winning winter percussion win 3rd in world
            finals.

            &emsp; While the photo linked below doesn't relate to them, and is more an example of the typ eof performance
            Fairmont would put on, I performed within the Marching Firebirds in the 2021 and 2022 school year respectively.  
            I performed the show titled 'All Wound Up' in 2021 and 'Everest' within 2022, chooisng to abstain from the 2023 season and 2024 season respectively.
