            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p>&emsp; Having been on Honor Roll for the entire amount of my middle school and high school career,
                I've taken great pride in the fact that I've been able to keep up my grades and prove myself
                within my community, up through Junior Year, to show what I'm able ot accomplish.  I've kept Straight A's through all of Freshman, Sophomore, and Junior
                year and through the first semester of Senior Year so far.  
            </p>
            <p>&emsp; So far I'm 18th in my class out of 607 kids to my knowledge and 
                have held said spot with a 4.0 Unweighted GPA and 4.3182 Weighted GPA through 
                Junior Year. </p>
            <p>&emsp; In my Junior Year, I was selected to attend the state BPA competition for Computer Hardware and placed 10th within the entire state, 
                out of potentially dozens or hundreds of others travelling from other counties or distrcts.  The competition was held 2024 in Colombus, Ohio.
