            &emsp;Hello, my name is Logan Stare and I am the designer and creator of this website.
            I’ve always been interested in technology from a young age, growing up in a tech-focused household.
            It’s been a dream of mine to work day to day with the interest I love, but it for sure isn’t the only thing
            I like doing in my free time.
            I also love playing TTRPGs, whether it be D&D, Pathfinder, or Warhammer 40k with friends on weekends.
            When I’m not messing with tech or playing TTRPGs I’m usually playing video games.
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp;Some major projects I’ve been involved in are the building of Fairmont High School’s new computers(Image to
            the right here).
            Recently they upgraded their gaming and engineering computers, so I was entrusted with building 2 of their
            new computers and both have passed tests with flying colors.
            In addition to that, There is this project that I have been tasked with working on and completing(of which
            you are viewing at this moment).
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp;Though I am interested in tech, It is not the only thing I use. Some of my favorite music is from Get Scared
            or Set it Off!
            I also am looking forward to the new Linkin Park album, which may have been released by the time anyone
            reads this.
            Some of my favorite book series include ‘His Dark Materials’ by Phillip Pullman showcasing the ‘golden
            compass’ trilogy, and
            I’m excited to continue reading the rest of the books here soon. In addition to all of that, I’ve also
            traveled a decent amount of the United States,
            having spent a few days or weeks in South and North Carolina, Florida, Kentucky, Indiana, and Missouri.
            I am always looking forward to traveling the US or even other countries in the future of my career!
